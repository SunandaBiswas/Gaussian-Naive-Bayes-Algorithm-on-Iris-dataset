# Gaussian-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm-on-Iris-dataset
I have used Gaussian Naive Bayes Model on Iris dataset that can predict the flower species based on the selected feature values.  Moreover, Scikit-learn library has been used here to train the model as well as Seaborn has been used for visualization through pair plot and heatmap.
